# Task Management System

**Problem Statement:** Create a web-based task management system that allows users to create, update, and manage their tasks efficiently.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

1. Develop a user-friendly web interface to interact with the task management system.
2. Implement a backend to handle user requests and perform CRUD operations on tasks.
3. Set up a database to store tasks and user-related information.
4. Create a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.
5. Provide essential task management features for users to organize and track their tasks effectively.

## Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up for an account to access the task management system.
   - Secure user authentication is implemented to protect user data.

2. **Task Creation, Viewing, and Updates:**
   - Users can create tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priorities.
   - Tasks can be viewed, updated, and deleted from the user interface.

3. **Task Filtering and Sorting:**
   - Users can filter tasks based on status (complete/incomplete), priority, or due date.
   - Tasks can be sorted based on various criteria, such as due date or priority.

4. **Task Completion and Progress Tracking:**
   - Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete to track their progress.
   - Option to set milestones or completion percentages to monitor task progress.

5. **Task Comments and Collaboration:**
   - Users can add comments or notes to tasks to facilitate collaboration.
   - Comments allow team members to communicate about specific tasks.

6. **Task Categories and Labels:**
   - Users can categorize tasks using labels or tags to organize tasks effectively.
   - Tasks can be filtered based on different categories or labels.

7. **Task Reminders and Notifications:**
   - Users receive reminders or notifications for tasks with due dates.
   - Email notifications or in-app reminders are provided for upcoming or overdue tasks.

8. **User Roles and Permissions:**
   - Admin and regular user roles are implemented with varying levels of access.
   - Admin users have additional privileges like managing user accounts or creating teams.

9. **Security Considerations:**
   - Secure user authentication with password hashing and encryption.
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection.

10. **Mobile Responsiveness:**
    - The user interface is optimized to be responsive and usable on various devices.

11. **User Analytics and Insights:**
    - Integration of analytics tools to gather data on user behavior.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building the user interface.

- **Backend:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for handling user requests and business logic.

- **Database:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for storing tasks and user-related data.

- **API:** Create a RESTful API using Express.js to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

- **Authentication:** Implement [JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](https://jwt.io/) for secure user authentication.

- **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for accessibility from anywhere.
